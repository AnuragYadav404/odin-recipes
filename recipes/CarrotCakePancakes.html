    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>How does "cake for breakfast" sound? The spices in these pancakes take you right to the flavors of a carrot cake. They are drizzled with a thin frosting and topped with raisins, coconut flakes, nuts, and candied ginger.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>20 chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ cup red pepper sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake wings in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cooked through and crispy.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine melted butter, red pepper sauce, tomato sauce, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Mix together.</li>
        <li>When wings are baked, dip in sauce to coat well, then shake off excess and return coated wings to baking sheet. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) and bake for another 15 minutes to set sauce.</li>
