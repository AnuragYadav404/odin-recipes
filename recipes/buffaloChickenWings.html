    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe was by far the most untraditional of the bunch. For starters, the wings are baked, not fried, giving them a slightly different texture. The wings were still crispy, but not as shatteringly crisp as the others. But the thing that made these wings truly unique was the sauce. Made with a combination of butter, hot sauce, tomato sauce, chili powder, and cayenne pepper, the result tasted a bit like a thick chili meets Buffalo sauce. The sauce gets tossed on the baked wings, then the wings get baked once again to help "set" the sauce. The resulting wings are more lacquered than saucy and have a faint warmth that is significantly less spicy and acidic than most Buffalo sauces. For anyone who loves wings but isn't a fan of typical Buffalo sauce, this recipe is a great alternative.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>20 chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ cup red pepper sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake wings in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cooked through and crispy.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine melted butter, red pepper sauce, tomato sauce, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Mix together.</li>
        <li>When wings are baked, dip in sauce to coat well, then shake off excess and return coated wings to baking sheet. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) and bake for another 15 minutes to set sauce.</li>
